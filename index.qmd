## PyMC Labs

I'm currently a Data Scientist at [PyMC Labs](https://www.pymc-labs.com/), the Bayesian AI consultancy founded by the creators of PyMC. PyMC Labs partners with organisations worldwide to design, implement, and optimise bespoke Bayesian models, from Media Mix Modelling and marketing analytics to AI systems and causal inference. I joined the team in January 2025 and contribute to client projects and open-source tooling in the Bayesian marketing and analytics space.
