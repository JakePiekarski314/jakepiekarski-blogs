# Quarto Site Verification

When making changes to the Quarto site (config, content, styles, or publish workflow), always verify the site works by:

1. **Re-rendering** the site with:
   ```bash
   QUARTO_PYTHON=/opt/anaconda3/envs/blogs/bin/python /Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/app/quarto/bin/quarto preview
   ```

2. **Opening** the site in the browser (the preview command outputs a URL like `http://localhost:XXXX/` — run `open <url>` to open it).

Or combine: run `quarto preview` in the background, wait for it to start, then `open` the URL from the terminal output.

Use RStudio's bundled Quarto at `/Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/app/quarto/bin/quarto` and the `blogs` conda env Python for execution.
