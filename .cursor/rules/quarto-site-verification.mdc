# Quarto Site Verification

When the user asks to "render and open" (or similar), or when making changes to the Quarto site (config, content, styles, or publish workflow), **do this by default**:

1. Run `quarto preview` in the background (starts the dev server and renders).
2. Wait a few seconds for it to start, then read the terminal output for the URL (e.g. `http://localhost:XXXX/`).
3. Run `open <url>` to open the site in the browser.

```bash
# Path to Quarto (RStudio bundled):
/Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/app/quarto/bin/quarto preview
```

Run the preview in the project root. The preview command outputs a URL; run `open <url>` to open it in the browser.
